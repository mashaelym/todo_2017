<h1> <b>Personal<b> </h1>
<p> My name is Mashael and I am from Saudi Arabia. I came to the states about three years ago and lived a while in Iowa to work on my English and GRE. I live in NJ with my husband and baby whom I love to spend time with. We like to barbeque, play mini golf, and travel a lot! </p>
<h1> Experience </h1>
<p> My major is Information Systems and I have background in management and accounting. I have learned Java and SQL and would love to learn more programming languages. I have an experience of one year and a half as a teaching assistant and I would like to work in academia. </p>

<h2> Looking forward to work with everyone! </h2>
